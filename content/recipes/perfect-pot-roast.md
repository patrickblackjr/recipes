Truly the best melt-in-your-mouth pot roast, cooked low and slow and simmered until perfection. Serve with crusty bread!

## Ingredients

- 4 pounds boneless chuck roast (excess fat trimmed)
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper (to taste)
- 2 tablespoons canola oil
- 1 medium sweet onion (cut into 1-inch wedges)
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- 4 cloves garlic (minced)
- 1 cup dry red wine*
- 1 cup beef stock
- 3 large carrots (cut into 3-inch pieces)
- 8 ounces cremini mushrooms
- 4 sprigs fresh thyme
- 1 sprig fresh rosemary
- 1 1/2 pounds small Yukon gold potatoes
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.
1. Season beef with 2 teaspoons salt and 3/4 teaspoon black pepper.
1. Heat canola oil in a Dutch oven over medium high heat. Add beef and cook until evenly browned, about 5-6 minutes per side; set aside.
1. Reduce heat to medium. Add onion, and cook, stirring frequently, until tender, about 5 minutes.
1. Stir in tomato paste and garlic until fragrant, about 1 minute.
1. Stir in wine and beef stock, scraping any browned bits from the bottom of the Dutch oven.
1. Stir in carrots, mushrooms, thyme and rosemary; season with salt and pepper, to taste. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer. Top with beef.
1. Place into oven, covered, and bake for 2 hours. Uncover and add potatoes; place into oven, covered, and bake until beef is fork-tender, about 1 hour to 1 hour and 30 minutes.
1. Let stand 15 minutes. Remove beef from the Dutch oven; shred, using two forks.
1. Serve beef, potatoes, carrots and mushrooms with juices immediately, garnished with parsley, if desired.
